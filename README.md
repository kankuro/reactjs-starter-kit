# ReactJS Starter Kit
A basic starter kit for ReactJS project.

## Usage

**Clone the repo**
```
git clone https://github.com/kankuro/reactjs-starter-kit.git
```
or if you want to clone the repository into a directory other than `reactjs-starter-kit`, you can specify the new directory name as an additional argument like so:
```
git clone https://github.com/kankuro/reactjs-starter-kit.git react-boilerplate
```
That command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target directory is called `react-boilerplate`.

**Install dependencies**
```
npm i
```
or
```
npm install
```

**Start the server**
```
npm run start
```
It will automatically open a default browser of your machine at port `8000`.

**Builds**

Development
```
npm run dev
```
Production
```
npm run build
```
Everytime you do a build it will automatically clean the `build` folder to insure it has a latest copy.
